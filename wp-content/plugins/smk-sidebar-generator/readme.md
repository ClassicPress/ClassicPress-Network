This plugin generates as many sidebars as you need. Then allows you to place them on any page you wish.

#### Version 3.0 is here!
The new version 3.x has many advantages compared with the old 2.x. First and the most important is that it remove the need to add some special code to the theme in order to display the generated sidebar. That's because it now can override the default sidebar and apply special conditions for any page on your site.

Because you probably still need them, these functions are still here to not break your site.
**Note:** The following code is for vesion 2.x In the latest version of this plugin they are not required. Do not use them anymore!!!

**Display a sidebar using `smk_sidebar` function:**
<pre>
if(function_exists('smk_sidebar'){
 smk_sidebar('sidebarID');
}
</pre>
**Display a sidebar using wp native function:**
<pre>
if(function_exists('dynamic_sidebar') && dynamic_sidebar('sidebarID')) : 
	endif;
</pre>

**Display a sidebar using built-in shortcode:**
<pre>
[smk_sidebar id="sidebarID"]
</pre>

== Installation ==
