"%sWhat is it:%s As part of the Adobe Creative SDK, Adobe offers a Photoshop-"
"like image editor for the web. LayerSlider uses this service, so you can "
"perform common tasks like resizing, cropping, rotating images, as well as "
"photo retouching, adding frames, text, effects, stickers and a lot more."
