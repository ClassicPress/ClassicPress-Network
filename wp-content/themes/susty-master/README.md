# Susty üåç

Hello. I'm a super-lightweight theme called `Susty`. I have been built to demonstrate how small a WordPress site can be (just 6KB of data transfer, or 7 with Yoast!).

**Note:** I am an experiment in minimalism, which means that the aim of this theme is to provide _just enough_ code to power the interface of [Susty WP](https://sustywp.com). It is therefore not recommended that you just go ahead and activate for your production blog or website without making some adjustments first.

The goals of this theme are outlined in a blog post entitled, [Delivering WordPress in 7KB](https://blog.jacklenox.com/2018/06/04/delivering-wordpress-in-7kb/).
